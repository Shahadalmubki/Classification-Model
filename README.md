# Classification-Model
We are a group of data analysts. We received a request that we analyze data on the health of the fetus before birth to avoid any complications for the mother and fetus in order to preserve their health.
Based on the data available to us, we conducted a study to classify the health of the fetus, according to which the fetus is either normal, suspected, or infected, based on many factors, including heart rate, number of accelerations per second, fetal movement per second, uterine contractions, and others.
